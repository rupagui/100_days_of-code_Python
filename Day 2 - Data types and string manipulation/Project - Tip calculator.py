# Day 2 Project - Tip calculator
# Date: 12/11/2022

'''

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
